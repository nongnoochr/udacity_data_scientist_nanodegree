### Term 1:

#### Supervised Learning

##### Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

**Project Overview (From Udacity)**

Apply supervised learning techniques on data collected for the US census to help CharityML (a
fictitious charity organization) identify groups of people that are most likely to donate to their
cause.

**Project Description (From Udacity)**
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to
provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. To expand their potential donor
base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to
donate to the charity. Your goal will be to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learning
algorithms to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while under some
marketing constraints.

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
* Supervised learning
* Model evaluation and comparison
* Tuning models according to constraints

#### Deep Learning

##### Project: Create Your Own Image Classifier

**Project Overview (From Udacity)**

Define and train a neural network in PyTorch that learns to classify images; going from image
data exploration to network training and evaluation.

**Project Description**
Implementing an image classification application using a deep neural network. This application will train a
deep learning model on a dataset of images. It will then use the trained model to classify new images. You
will develop your code in a Jupyter notebook to ensure your implementation works well

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
* PyTorch and neural networks
* Model validation and evaluation

#### Unsupervised Learning


##### Project: Identify Customer Segments with Arvato

**Project Overview (From Udacity)**

Study a real dataset of customers for a company, and apply several unsupervised learning
techniques in order to segment customers into similar groups and extract information that
may be used for marketing or product improvement.

**Project Description**
In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for
customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data.
You will first explore and pre-process the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and
removing) unwanted outliers. With the cleaned customer spending data, you will apply PCA transformations
to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, you
will compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could
assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.

**Key Skills Demonstrated**
* Data cleaning
* Dimensionality reduction with PCA
* Unsupervised clustering
