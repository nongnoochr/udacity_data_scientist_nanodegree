### Term 1:

#### Supervised Learning

##### Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

**Project Highlights** (From Udacity)

This project is designed to get you acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

#### Deep Learning

#### Unsupervised Learning
